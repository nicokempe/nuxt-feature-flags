Lightweight, environment-based feature flag system for Nuxt 3 â€” made for developers who need dynamic feature control in routes, components, and APIs.

## ðŸš€ What is this?

This is a simple but powerful Nuxt 3 module that enables feature toggling for pages, components, and server routes â€” based on a developer-defined **environment** (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`, or any custom name).

- Fully static (`nuxt.config.ts` based)
- Framework-native: Directives, composables, and middleware
- Tree-shaking ready
- No external service or runtime API needed

## âœ¨ Use Cases

- Hide incomplete features in `production`
- Enable alpha/beta features in `staging` or `dev`
- Limit access to specific APIs
